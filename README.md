## Project features

## Plan on improving the project

- Consider adding a link in the Recipes section to James Hoffman's YouTube channel for more awesome coffee knowledge videos.
- Style the checkbox in the Menu section to better match the submit button to show it's relationship.
- Make the submit button in the Menu section disable until the checkbox accepting terms is checked.
